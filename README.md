# TTG
This is the C++ API for the Template Task Graph (TTG) programming model for flowgraph-based composition of high-performance algorithms executable on distributed heterogeneous computer platforms. The TTG API abstracts out the details of the underlying task and data flow runtime; the current realization is implemented using MADNESS and PaRSEC runtimes as backends.

# Installation

- To try out TTG in a Docker container, install Docker, then execute `bin/docker-build.sh` and follow instructions in `bin/docker.md`;
- See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/TESSEorg/ttg/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to learn how to build and install TTG.
