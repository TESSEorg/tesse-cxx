# TTG
This is the C++ API for the Template Task Graph (TTG) programming model for flowgraph-based composition of high-performance algorithms executable on distributed heterogeneous computer platforms. The TTG API abstracts out the details of the underlying task and data flow runtime; the current realization is implemented using MADNESS and PaRSEC runtimes as backends.
